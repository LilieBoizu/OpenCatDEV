These files are Python scripts to control Nybble thanks to Raspberry Pi and a camera
(see configuration on Assembly Instructions from Petoi : https://docs.petoi.com/ )

The ardSerial.py file, from Petoi, is needed --> https://github.com/PetoiCamp/OpenCat

*** Need to install opencv on Raspberry, see : https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/19/pip-install-opencv/
--> go to the "How to pip install OpenCV on Raspberry Pi" section 

*** Some scripts need TensorFlow : https://itnext.io/installing-tensorflow-2-3-0-for-raspberry-pi3-4-debian-buster-11447cb31fc4
